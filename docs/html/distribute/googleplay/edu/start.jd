<p>If you've got a great app for education or just an idea for one, plan to be a
part of Google Play for Education to reach even more teachers and students. It's
easy to participate, and you will be able to offer new or existing Android apps
using the familiar tools in Google Play.</p>

<p>To get started, review the sections in this document and learn about the
safety, usability, and quality guidelines that apps should meet. Assess your
apps against these guidelines and make any adjustments needed. You can use the
linked resources to help you develop a great app for students that offers
compelling content and an intuitive user experience on Android tablets.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Safety First</h2>

<p>To participate, your apps must be designed to be usable and appropriate for
the K-12 market. The basic requirements that your apps must meet are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apps and the ads they contain must not collect personally identifiable
information other than user credentials or data required to operate and improve
the app.</li>
  <li>Apps must not use student data for purposes unrelated to its educational
function.</li>
  <li>Apps must have a content rating of "Everyone" or "Low Maturity" (apps with
a "Medium Maturity" rating are allowed, if they have that rating solely because
they allow communication between students).</li>
  <li>App content, including ads displayed by the app, must be consistent with
the app's maturity rating. The app must not display any “offensive” content, as
described in the <a
href="http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">Google Play
Developer Program Policies</a> and <a
href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/188189">
content-rating guidelines</a>.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2 id="approved">With the Help of Educators</h2>

<p>App content submitted to Google Play for Education will be reviewed by
educators who will categorize the apps and align them with <a
href="http://www.corestandards.org/" class="external-link"
target="_android">Common Core Standards</a>. This will help make your content
discoverable in a way that is easy for teachers and administrators. </p>


<h2 id="secure">Sold Simply</h2>

<p>Google Play for Education provides a simple and secure environment in which
educators can buy apps in a way that's easy for schools &mdash; through purchase
orders. Your apps must support this environment by ensuring that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sell all content and services through Google Play for Education</li>
  <li>Permit Google Play to offer teachers limited free trials before purchase
(through business terms only, no development work is needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, it's highly recommended that your apps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disable in-app purchase in any UI accessible to students.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quality">High Quality and Usability</h2>

<p>Google Play for Education brings educational content to students and teachers
on Android tablets. Your apps should be designed to perform well and look great
on Android tablets, and they should offer the best user experience possible.
</p>

<p>High quality apps are engaging, intuitive, and offer compelling content.
Google Play for Education will highlight high-quality apps for easy discovery in
the store. Here are some recommendations for making your app easy for students
and teachers to enjoy.</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="strategies">Strategies for Development</h2>

  <p>If you have an existing educational app in Google Play, the classroom
environment offered by Google Play for Education presents a slightly different
set of needs, requirements, and also opportunities.</p> 

  <p>We're working to give you the tools you need to build for the classroom
environment from a single APK, delivered as a single product to all of your
users in Google Play. Our goal is to let you customize your app's UI and
features as minimally or deeply as you need, to provide a simple, intuitive, and
beautiful learning experience. </p>

  <p>Watch for more information on developer tools coming in the weeks ahead.
We'll update this page as we roll out tools for you to use. As a starting point,
we recommend planning your app's design and ensuring its optimization on Nexus
tablets.</p>
