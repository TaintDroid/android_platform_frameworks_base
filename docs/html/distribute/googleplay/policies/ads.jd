<p>
  Google Play policies guide how you can use ads in your apps, to help ensure
  the best experience for users visiting and downloading apps from the store.
</p>

<p>
  In general, for the purposes of policy, the content of ads displayed by your
  app is considered part of your app. As an app developer, it is your
  responsibility to ensure that the content, context, and behavior of ads in
  your apps conforms to Google Play policies.
</p>

<p>
  Before you publish, make sure you understand Google Play ad policies and how
  to display ads in conformance with those policies. The sections below
  highlight best practices and common examples to help you avoid the most
  common types of policy violations.
</p>

<p>
  For more information about Google Play policies that apply to your apps and
  content, please see the <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html" target=
  "_policies">Developer Program Policies</a> and <a href=
  "http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html" target=
  "_policies">Developer Distribution Agreement</a>.

<h2 id="content-maturity">Content and Maturity</h2>

<div class="example-block bad">
  <div class="heading">Ad maturity exceeds app</div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-maturity-violation.png">
</div>

<p>
  From a policy perspective, ads shown in your app are part of your content
  and your app is responsible for any violations. If an ad shown in your app
  violates Google Play policies, your app may be suspended or your developer
  account terminated.
</p>

<p>
  For this reason, it's important for you to be be aware of what ads will be
  displayed in your app and to manage the ads content according to Google Play
  policies. Here are some guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Ads must not violate Content Policy</strong>&mdash;Ads in
        your app must not violate the terms of Google Play’s Content Policy,
        including those concerning illegal activities, violence, sexually
        explicit content, or privacy violations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ads maturity must be consistent with your app's
        maturity</strong>&mdash;Content shown in your ads must be consistent
        with the app’s maturity rating in Google Play. Especially, ads content
        should never exceed your app's maturity rating, even if the ads content
        by itself complies with general policies.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the example at right, the app's maturity rating is set to
  "Everyone", which is the lowest maturity level on Google Play. By choosing
  the "Everyone" maturity level, the developer is declaring that all of the
  content in the app, <em>including ads</em>, is suitable for all users
  regardless of age.
</p>

<p>
  The example app violates Google Play policies by displaying ad content with a
  higher maturity level&mdash;ad content showing gambling, profanity, user
  location, suggestive content, or content from another app with higher
  maturity exceeds the "Everyone" maturity rating. Because the ad's
  maturity is higher than the app's maturity level, the app itself is in
  violation of policy. To correct the problem, the developer must either
  restrict ads content to "Everyone" level or raise the app's maturity rating.
</p>

<p>
  For detailed information about how to choose the appropriate maturity level
  for your app, or to assess the maturity requirement of ads in your app, see

<h2 id="context">Context and Behavior</h2>

<p>
  If your app displays ads, it should do so in ways that do not interrupt users,
  mislead them into clicking on ads, or make changes outside the app without
  the user's knowledge or consent. Here are some guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Display your ads within your UI</strong>&mdash;If possible,
    display ads only within your app's UI. This leads to a better user
    experience and helps avoid policy violations
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Make sure app origin is clear</strong>&mdash;When you display an
    ad, it must be clear to the user that the ad has originated from your app.
    If you show the ad in your app's UI while your app has focus, the user
    understands the ad origin without explicit attribution. However, if you
    display the ad outside of your app, such as in a notification, you must
    explicitly indicate the origin.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Don't make changes outside of the app without consent</strong>
   &mdash;Ads must not make changes outside of the app without the user's
    full knowledge and consent. For example, ads should not install shortcuts,
    bookmarks, or icons, or change default settings without user consent.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Changes outside the app must be reversible</strong>&mdash;If an
    ad makes changes outside the app as described above, the changes (and
    origin app) must be evident and easily reversible. For example, the user
    must be able to locate and reverse the changes by adjusting settings,
    changing ad preferences in the app, or uninstalling the app altogether.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Notification ads require user opt-in</strong>&mdash;Your app
    should not create <a href=
    "{@docRoot}design/patterns/notifications.html">notifications</a>
    containing ads unless the user has specifically opted-in to this behavior
    and is able to easily opt-out.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Use low priority for notification ads</strong>&mdash;Always
    assign your notification ads <a href="
    {@docRoot}reference/android/app/Notification.html#PRIORITY_LOW">low
    priority</a> (for API level 16 and above).
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="example-block bad" style="width:400px;margin:.5em 0 0 2em;">
    <div class="heading">Does not fully indicate origin app</div>
    <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-notif-attr-violation.png">
</div>
<div class="example-block good" style="width:400px;margin:.5em 0 0 2em;">
    <div class="heading">Indicates origin app by name and icon</div>
    <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-notif-attr.png">
</div>

<p>
  In particular, note that notification ads must clearly identify your app as
  the ad origin. If your app sends notification ads that do not sufficiently
  identify your app as the origin, the app will be in violation of policy.
</p>

<p>
  To identify your app as the origin, you should display the <strong>app's full
  name and and icon</strong> in the notification to provide the clearest
  identification and best policy compliance. Displaying a partial app name can
  also be sufficient, provided the name unambiguously identifies your app.
</p>

<p>
  Above right is an example notification ad that violates ad policy by not
  providing attribution of the origin app. Below right, the notification ads
  comply with policy by providing both the app icon and full app name (in this
  case, "Turtle Test").
</p>


<h2 id="disclosure" style="clear:right">Disclosure of Ads to Users</h2>

<p>
  It's important to sufficiently disclose to users how your app will use ads.
  You must make it easy for users to understand what ads will be shown in your
  app, where they will be shown, and what the associated behaviors are, if any.
  Further, you should ask for user consent and provide options for managing ads
  or opt-out. Here are some guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tell users about your ads</strong>&mdash;Create a simple,
    complete disclosure that tells users how your app uses ads, where the ads
    are shown, and how they can manage ad options. Take common-sense steps to
    make the disclosure as clear as possible.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Make sure users know</strong>&mdash;Present your ads disclosure
    is an easy-to-see location, rather than hiding it where users are not
    likely to find it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Ask for consent (opt-in) at launch</strong>&mdash;Where possible,
    include your ads disclosure in the app description as well as in an Ads
    Terms, End User License Agreement (EULA), or similar document. Display the
    terms at first launch and ask for the user's consent before continuing to
    the app.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A recommended approach is to provide an ads disclosure in an End-User License
  Agreement (EULA). The disclosure should be clear and succinct and displayed
  in a modal dialog that asks the user to agree to the terms before using the
  app.
</p>

<p>
  If your app adds homescreen icons and/or browser bookmarks, an acceptable
  practice for revealing that behavior is to provide a disclosure in both the
  app description and an opt-in EULA on app launch. This ensures that the
  behaviors are clearly explained to the user up-front and requires the user’s
  consent in a pop-up EULA to continue using the app.
</p>

</div>

<p style="clear:right">
  Above left is an example of ads disclosure that is hidden in a long EULA. The
  disclosure information itself is not clearly indicated in the document text
  and it's not visible unless the user happens to scroll down far enough in the
  EULA. Above middle and right show two alternative approaches that
  present the disclosure in an obvious and clear manner at the top of a
  EULA and in a dedicated Terms agreement. 
</p>


<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation of System UI</h2>

<div class="example-block bad">
  <div class="heading">Ad impersonates system dialog</div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-impersonate-violation.png">
</div>

<p>
  Your app must not display any ad that attempts to impersonate or represent a
  system function or UI component. If such an ad is displayed in your app, your
  app will be in violation of policy and subject to suspension. Here are some
  guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No fake system dialogs or warnings</strong>&mdash;Any ad that
    presents itself as a system dialog or warning and asks for user input is in
    violation of Google Play policies.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>No fake app updates</strong>&mdash;Ads should not impersonate
    system UI for app updates.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  At right is an example of a pop-up ad impersonating a system dialog, warning
  the user about viruses. This is a violation of policy.
</p>


<h2 id="adwalls">Adwalls</h2>

<div class="example-block good" style="width:213px;">
  <div class="heading">Adwall lets user cancel</div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-paywall.png">
</div>

<div class="example-block bad" style="width:213px;">
  <div class="heading">Adwall forces user action</div>
  <img src="{@docRoot}images/gp-policy-ads-paywall-violation.png">
</div>

<p>
  If your app uses adwalls to drive affiliate traffic, those adwalls must not
  force the user to click on ads or submit personal information for advertising
  purposes before using the app.
</p>

<p>
  Forcing a user action in an adwall is not only a poor user experience, it is
  a violation of Google Play policies.
</p>

<p>
  For this reason, <strong>all adwalls must give the user the option to
  cancel</strong> or otherwise dismiss the ad without penalty.
</p>

<p>
  At right is an example of an app that requires the user to click through the
  ad to fully use the app. This is a violation of policy.
</p>

<p>
  The adjacent example demonstrates an adequate option to let the user dismiss
  the ad wall easily by cancelling.
</p>


<h2 id="interfering" style="clear:right;">Interference with Third-party Ads and Websites</h2>

<p>
  Ads associated with your app <strong>must not interfere</strong> with any
  other ads originating in other applications.
</p>
